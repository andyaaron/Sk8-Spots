"# Description: The project was created with AngularJS, Ionic and Cordova. The app initially loads up a map, which is centered on NC
   for the time being. In the future, the map will center on the user's location, with the ability to add skate spots nearby, to share 
   with other users. There is also a log tab, which allows users to locally store accomplishments at skate spots for record keeping purposes.
