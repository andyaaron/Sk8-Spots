Description: The project was created with AngularJS, Ionic and Cordova. The app initially loads up a map, which is centered on NC
   for the time being. In the future, the map will center on the user's location, with the ability to add skate spots nearby, to share 
   with other users. There is also a log tab, which allows users to locally store accomplishments at skate spots for record keeping purposes.

# What is currently working?

## Account Page
Allows user to sign in and out, and create an account. Email verification does not work yet, although angular handles email and password authentication decently.

## Map Page
Currently displays the map, although not how I'd like it to. User entry is not yet functional, although should be within the next fe w updates.

## Sk8 Log Page
Able to make entries, although they show up the same for everyone! Currently working on having firebase make a storage space for each user in the database, so they can input their entries and spit them back to just the specific user.
